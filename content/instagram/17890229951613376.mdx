    Material: Breccia Capraia Marble

    This masterpiece of a stone is called Breccia Capraia. It is a purple-veined marble found in the Messa province in Tuscany. It is sometimes also referred to as "Marmo Capraia." We completely understand why the designer chose to use it for the countertops, island, and decorative cladding for the hood. With a stone this beautiful we would have trouble not using it for the ceiling and floors as well!
