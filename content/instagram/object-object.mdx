    It's that time of year again when we all want to get cozy and gather around a fireplace. This one designed by Natalie Herbert is absolutely stunning. It's grand and stately while not being at all flashy. That is what a great piece of natural stone can do and I love the low profile of the hearth how it transitions into the flooring. Thinking of redoing your own fireplace? Then stay tuned as we will be posting more fireplace goals in the coming weeks!⠀
