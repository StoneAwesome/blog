    Title: Stained Oak Outdoor Kitchen

    Design: Bonnie Edelman

    Material: Calacatta Marble


    Marble? Outdoors??? Has everything we've been told been a lie? Bonnie Edelman decided to break all the "granite only" rules and selected marble for this stunning oversized outdoor island. How did she do it? Well, it is protected under a stained oak solid ceiling pagoda. Even the kitchen appliances have added protection in case of rain with a hidden drop-down metal gate. Are you brave enough to break the long held "granite only" outdoor rule? Let us know in the comments below!
